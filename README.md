# chatbot_using_reformer
built a chatbot using reformer model:

It has efficient memory and computation

1.revnet-reversible ayers for saving memory by easy recomputation of activations instead of storing them for n-decoder-layers.Reversible Residual Networks (RevNets) organization to reduce the storage requirements when doing backpropagation in training.

2.LSH - locally sensitive hashing(LSH) attention reduces the cost of the Dot Product attention for large input sizes.
